# Digital App Autopsy
The Digital App Autopsy is intended for use for digital dissections similar to those completed on physical products. While the name of the site implies the inspection of a dead object, the Digital App Autopsy is a tool designed to help online users perform dissections on living artifacts; websites and other digital applications which are frequently still in use, and still capable of being transformed. The site attempts to reveal elements of digital design that often cannot be directly seen through the interface of a website or digital application. In addition, it attempts to classify the tools used to build websites in a manner that would align the digital application with a corresponding value based on a variety of different criteria. In this sense, the Digital Application Autopsy attempts to engage in an artifact-altering strategy, through revealing the distribution of wealth, power, and status that can are carried by digital applications and are frequently ignored or veiled. Various service technologies can be used, but the default installation uses a modified version of whatweb.
